# Koch Curves
Koch curves is a type of fractal. Originally the most known form of this fractal family is Koch Snowflake.

# How it works
In the current implementation, after the drawing finished on canvas, I send the vertices to a javascript method calculates every vertices generated by Koch algorithm and at the end these point goes to a GPU vertex buffer and drawn with the help of webGL.

# Compile and Run
I didnt use any external library of framework. I used plain HTML5, CSS3, and javasciript. You can run it by opening index.html via a browser(Chrome and Firefox tested).
